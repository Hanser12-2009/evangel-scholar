# Evangel Scholar - My First Coding Project

A studying app that I built during the computers class at Evangel University.

## What I Built

I built an app called Evangel Scholar, it is designed to help with studying!

- 📚 **Interactive Flashcards** - Digital study cards with flip functionality
- ⏰ **Study Timer** - 25-minute focus sessions with prayer break reminders  
- 📝 **Note Taking** - Capture important thoughts and insights
- 🎨 **Professional Design** - Clean interface with Evangel University branding

## Technologies Used

- React (JavaScript framework)
- CSS-in-JS for styling
- CodeSandbox for development
- Modern web development practices

## My Learning Journey

This project represents my first experience with coding. Over 7 days, I learned:

- How to build interactive web applications
- The fundamentals of React and JavaScript
- User interface design principles
- Problem-solving through code
